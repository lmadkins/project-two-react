- I want to be able to quickly enter my location within Portland and look up public restroom options near me, sorted by nearest options
- I want to know whether it meets certain criterea (All-Gender, ADA accessible, has changing tables)
- I want to know how to get there
- I want to know what type of establishment it is, its location, and whether it is open

Stretch:
I want to know whether the place is open
I want to only see places that meet my needs (ADA, etc)
